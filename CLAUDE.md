Please thoroughly read the SUMMARY.md on design choices and tradeoffs and our overall vision and requirements.

Then read the TODO.md for a list of what is to be done.

Follow TDD.  Always write a failing test first before adding/modifying/refactoring code and then make it work

When you are writing functions - explain what is is meant to do and how it fits in the larger picture in its comments (Do not worry about trivial details).
When you modify functions see if the comments also needs an update on its purpose and behavior.
